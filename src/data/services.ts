      "Warrior Removals provides full house removals across Wigan, WN postcodes and Greater Manchester, from one-bedroom flats to five-bedroom family homes. We handle packing, furniture dismantling and reassembly, careful loading and unloading, and room-by-room placement at your new address. Use our moving cost calculator for a guide estimate, then receive a fixed written removal quote after a free in-person or video survey.",
      "Moving house takes planning. Our teams survey access, parking and loading at both addresses before moving day, so terraced streets, tight town-centre bays and narrow hallways are priced in, from Standishgate and Swinley out to Standish, Hindley and Leigh. We work through a practical moving checklist with you so nothing important is missed before the van arrives.",
      "Every home move includes protective blankets and stretch wrap for furniture, careful loading in our 3.5-tonne Luton vans, and placement of every item in the right room at your new address. Optional packing, dismantling and reassembly services turn it into a genuinely full-service move, not a one-person man-and-van hire. Our crews are trained in domestic removals techniques, not general labour, so your belongings are handled with consistent care from the front door to the final room.",
      "Moves within WN1-WN8 or further afield are treated the same way. We confirm volume, crew size and timing at survey, label boxes by room where we pack, and load so fragile items travel on top and heavy furniture is strapped. Goods in transit are covered at £50,000 per vehicle load, with £1 million public liability insurance, as set out in our terms and conditions. Customers rate us 5.0 out of 5 on Google.",
      "We are a removals company, not a waste clearance service. We move your household belongings, furniture, boxes, appliances and personal items, from one home to another. We do not take rubbish, unwanted items for disposal, or general waste as part of a house removal. If you need to declutter before moving day, that should be arranged separately so the van is loaded only with what you are taking to your new home.",
      "You get a clear written quote before we start, with no hidden extras for standard access and agreed services. Our removal quotes reflect bedrooms, distance, packing requirements and any dismantling needed, confirmed after survey, not guessed on the day. Book two to three weeks ahead where possible, though we can often help with shorter notice across Wigan. Call 01942 565786 or email info@wiganremoval.co.uk; we work 7am-9pm, seven days a week, from 61-69 Standishgate, Wigan WN1 1AH.",

Use our moving cost calculator beforehand for a guide estimate; the survey confirms the final price.",

Boxes and furniture are secured in the Luton van with straps so nothing shifts in transit. At your new home, everything is placed in the correct room, not left in the hallway, so you can unpack in an organised way.",
          "If you have booked packing services, those usually happen the day before the move so the property is ready to load efficiently. Dismantling and reassembly of beds and wardrobes is coordinated as part of the same crew visit where quoted.

Cover details, exclusions and claims procedures are set out in our terms and conditions. Fragile items packed by our team qualify for breakage cover under GIT; self-packed boxes are moved carefully but breakages inside them are not claimable.",

      {
        q: "Do you offer packing as part of a house removal?",
        a: "Yes. Choose full packing, part packing (typically kitchen and fragiles), or pack yourself with our materials. Professional packing is usually done the day before moving day. Packing can be included in your removal quote after survey, and it affects insurance eligibility for fragile contents as described in our terms.",

Use our moving cost calculator for a guide estimate; fixed removal quotes are confirmed after a free in-person or video survey.",

Short-distance moves have their own logic: sometimes two quick trips with a 3.5-tonne Luton beats one slow load, and knowing where to park on a narrow terraced street saves half an hour per trip. Local knowledge from Standishgate and Swinley out to Standish, Hindley, Leigh and Ashton-in-Makerfield means realistic timings and no wasted mileage on your removal quote.",

Short-distance domestic removals get the same care as long hauls: blankets, stretch wrap, straps, optional packing services, and dismantling and reassembly where quoted. This is a full crew service, not man-and-van-only hire.",
      "Local moves are priced fairly for what they are: shorter drive time typically means a lower overall price than a long-distance move of the same size, though loading and unloading effort is similar. Your fixed written quote after survey reflects volume and access, not an open-ended hourly rate charged to customers.",

We coordinate with your moving checklist, Wigan Council parking dispensations, elevator bookings in flats, and clear labelling, so short moves do not become stressful simply because the distance is small.",
